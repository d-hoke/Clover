The best way to compile is to use out of src build, like such:

mkdir some/path/build
cd some/path/build
cmake -DGALLIUM_DIR=/home/user/projects/mesa -DCLANG_SRC_DIR=/home/user/projects/llvm -DCLANG_BUILD_DIR=/home/user/build/llvm /home/user/projects/clover
make

That should be it, make sure that GALLIUM_DIR point to top of Mesa checkout and CLANG_SRC_DIR points to the llvm checkout that cointains Clang and CLANG_BUILD_DIR to the llvm build directory that contains Clang files (CLANG_SRC_DIR and CLANG_BUILD_DIR will be the same if you haven't used out of src build for LLVM/Clang)
